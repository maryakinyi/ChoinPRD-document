We are to create a web platform that will help students redeem Choin for the available rewards if activated by the admin and trainers being able to reward students. From the research, we conducted it was evident that awards were being given to the loudest students and leaving others un beneficiary of the rewards. We structure our development into 2 sections that align with the Product : Problem stage: Where the problem was clearly articulated to get to understand the problem we want to solve. Development /solution stage: There was how the system would look like and the inclusion of the wanted features. Problem stage We started by conducting research where there was a \u201cwhy\u201d question which was an initiative to define and understand the problem. So we spent a good amount of time researching the problem solution to have an understanding of the problem we are solving at the end. For this reason, Much time was spent defining the problem as determining the solution. This was the problem statement that was like a guide and enabled us to set goals and objectives for research: \u201cHow might we create a system to ensure efficiency in rewarding to promote trust and transparency within AkiraChix?\u201d Approximate Timeline with the time allocations clearly defined below. Afterwards, data analysis will be done to verify the data and statistics at hand.
